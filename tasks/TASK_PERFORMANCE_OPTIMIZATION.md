# Task: Arduino LED Controller Performance Optimization

## Objective
Optimize the Arduino LED controller code to achieve higher frame rates - approximately double the current stable rate of 42 FPS.

## Current Issues
- Current frame rate is stable at around 42 FPS
- Need to achieve approximately 80+ FPS
- Performance bottlenecks may be in the serial communication, frame processing, or LED update logic

## Requirements
- Maintain all existing functionality
- Keep compatibility with the existing protocol
- Focus on performance optimizations in the Arduino code

## Implementation Steps
1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Review current code and identify bottlenecks
   - Benchmark current performance
   - Identify potential optimization strategies

2. **Optimization Implementation**
   - Optimize serial communication
   - Improve buffer management
   - Enhance frame processing logic
   - Optimize FastLED usage
   - Review and potentially modify color smoothing implementation
   - Improve delta frame encoding/processing

3. **Testing and Benchmarking**
   - Measure frame rate improvements
   - Test compatibility with existing setup
   - Verify stability over extended periods

4. **Documentation**
   - Document all optimizations made
   - Update comments with performance considerations
   - Provide recommendations for further improvements

## Success Criteria
- Stable frame rate of 80+ FPS
- No loss of existing functionality
- No introduction of new bugs or instability
