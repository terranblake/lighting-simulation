# Arduino LED Controller Performance Optimizations

## Summary of Optimizations

The following optimizations were implemented to increase the frame rate from ~42 FPS to a target of 80+ FPS:

1. **Serial Communication**
   - Increased baud rate from 74880 to 921600 for significantly faster data transfer
   - Implemented optimized bulk reading of serial data with `readSerialData()` function
   - Increased serial buffer size from 32 to 256 bytes
   - Added support for partial frame updates (only changed LEDs)
   - Switched to a more efficient binary communication protocol
   - Reduced validation overhead for performance-critical paths

2. **Color Smoothing**
   - Made color smoothing optional with `ENABLE_SMOOTHING` define (set to 0 by default)
   - Eliminated temporary array allocations in frame processing

3. **FastLED Optimizations**
   - Disabled dithering with `FastLED.setDither(0)`
   - Set maximum refresh rate to 0 with `setMaxRefreshRate(0, false)`
   - Removed extra function calls and allocations when processing color data

4. **Delta Frame Processing**
   - Implemented batched processing of LED changes with configurable batch size
   - Added conditional LED updates to skip `FastLED.show()` when no changes are needed
   - Optimized delta frame handling to read all data at once instead of byte-by-byte

5. **Frame Rate Limiting**
   - Removed minimum frame interval to maximize throughput
   - Eliminated frame dropping mechanism that was limiting performance

6. **Debug Output**
   - Disabled debug mode by default for better performance (`DEBUG_MODE = 0`)
   - Wrapped debug-related code in conditional blocks to avoid overhead when not needed
   - Simplified debug output to reduce processing time

7. **Memory Management**
   - Pre-allocated buffers for both full frame and delta updates
   - Eliminated unnecessary memory allocations in tight loops
   - Optimized data processing to work directly with buffers

8. **Loop Optimization**
   - Removed all delay calls in main processing loops
   - Optimized wait loops to minimize CPU usage while waiting for data

## Expected Results

These optimizations should significantly increase the frame rate from the current ~42 FPS to the target of 80+ FPS. The exact improvement will depend on the specific Arduino hardware being used and the LED strip characteristics.

## Further Optimization Possibilities

If additional performance is still needed:

1. Use direct port manipulation for LED control instead of FastLED library
2. Implement double-buffering for frame data
3. Further optimize the serial protocol to reduce overhead
4. Consider using DMA (Direct Memory Access) for supported Arduino boards
5. Implement more aggressive frame compression techniques
